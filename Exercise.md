# Exercise: Convert Desktop Application to Modern Web Application

## Objective
Transform the existing smart password manager desktop application into a modern web-based application.

## Steps

1. **Analyze the Current Application**
   - Review the codebase and understand the core features and logic implemented in the desktop version.
   - Identify modules and components that need to be migrated or refactored for web compatibility.

2. **Choose a Web Framework**
   - Use React and Node as a Frontend and Backend framework
   - Create a separated backend/frontend.

3. **Design the Web UI**
   - use Material Design as a design guide.
   - Ensure the UI is user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing.


4. **Implement Backend Logic**
   - Refactor core logic to run as web APIs (RESTful endpoints).
   - Handle authentication, password management, and data storage securely.

5. **Develop Frontend**
   - Build the frontend using chosen framework.
   - Integrate with backend APIs for all features.
   - Add modern UI elements and ensure cross-browser compatibility.

6. **Testing**
   - Write and run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both backend and frontend.
   - Perform usability and security testing.
   - Use Playwright for the test case generation

7. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the application for deployment (Docker, cloud hosting, etc.).
   - Document deployment steps and environment requirements.

## Deliverables
- Source code for the web application (backend and frontend).
- Updated documentation (README.md) with setup and usage instructions.
- Screenshots or demo video of the working web application.
- test coverage report showing above 85% coverage 

## Bonus
- Implement additional features such as password strength meter, password generator, or multi-factor authentication.
- Add support for mobile devices.

**Note:** Focus on modularity, security, and scalability while converting the application. Use best practices for web development and ensure sensitive data is handled securely.
